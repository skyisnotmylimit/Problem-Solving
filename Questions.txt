You have given an array A having N elements and an integer S. You have to find a maximum number X such that the sum of all its subarrays of size X is less than or equal to S.
Example Input:  
    A = [1, 3, 4, 2]  
    S = 7  
Example Output:  
    2  
Explanation:  
    All subarrays of size 2 have the sum less than 7.  
    Subarays are :  
    1. [1, 3]  
    2. [3, 4]  
    3. [4, 2]

I will cover the below question in a separate class. Donâ€™t worry, but you can try.
Deepthi loves cruises. She is going to visit the Caribbean on a Cruise. So, she thought of providing everyone who is traveling with her with lunch as well. Each food item is denoted by an integer ID. A lunch box contains exactly A food items. She has a list of food items with her denoted by an integer array B. She asked you to tell her the maximum number of lunchboxes she can prepare.

Note:
A lunch box can contain multiple same kinds of food items but the content of each lunch box should be the same.
Example Input
Input 1:
A = 3, B = [1, 2, 3, 2, 6, 1, 3]
Input 2:
A = 4, B = [1, 3, 1, 3, 10, 3, 6, 6, 13]
Example Output
Output 1:
2
Output 2:
1
Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
She can choose the content to be [1, 2, 3] and prepare 2 lunchboxes
Explanation 2:
